This web application allows users to register, log in, and efficiently manage their personal tasks. Each task can include a detailed description using a rich text editor, making it easier to organize ideas and complex requirements. In addition, each task can be assigned a priority level to facilitate management.

Tasks are linked to the user who creates them, ensuring privacy and personalization. The authentication system handles account creation and login, allowing each user to access only their own tasks.
